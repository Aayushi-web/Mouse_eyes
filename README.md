# Eye Gesture Recognition using Deep Learning

This project leverages deep learning techniques to recognize eye gestures, enabling intuitive human-computer interaction. By analyzing eye movements, the system can perform specific actions based on detected gestures.

## Features

- **Real-Time Eye Gesture Detection**: Utilizes deep learning models to process video input and identify eye gestures in real-time.
- **Intuitive Interaction**: Allows users to control applications or devices using predefined eye gestures, enhancing accessibility and user experience.
- **Deep Learning Integration**: Employs Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and other deep learning architectures to accurately classify eye gestures.

## Video Demonstration

## Installation, Requirements, and Usage

To set up and use the Eye Gesture Recognition project locally, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/eye-gesture-recognition.git
cd eye-gesture-recognition
### Step 2: Install Required Libraries
It's recommended to use a virtual environment for managing dependencies. If you don't have virtualenv installed, you can install it using:

bash
Copy
pip install virtualenv
Create and activate a virtual environment:

bash
Copy
# On Windows
virtualenv venv
venv\Scripts\activate

# On macOS/Linux
virtualenv venv
source venv/bin/activate
Then, install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy
pip install -r requirements.txt
### Step 3: Requirements
The following libraries and frameworks are required to run the project:

tensorflow or pytorch (depending on the deep learning framework you choose)

opencv-python (for video input processing)

numpy (for numerical operations)

dlib (for facial landmark detection)

imutils (for image processing)

mediapipe (optional, for enhanced eye tracking)

You can install all the required libraries by running:

bash
Copy
pip install -r requirements.txt
### Step 4: Prepare the Dataset
Ensure you have a dataset of eye images labeled with corresponding gestures. You can either use publicly available datasets or capture your own eye images performing various gestures.

### Step 5: Train the Model
Once the dataset is ready, use the provided script to train the deep learning model:

bash
Copy
python train_model.py --dataset path_to_dataset --epochs 50
Step 6: Run the Gesture Recognition
After training the model, you can use the recognition script to test the model with real-time video input:

bash
Copy
python recognize_gesture.py
This script will open a video window displaying the live feed and will overlay the predicted gesture on detected faces.
